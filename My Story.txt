My Story I AM MAKING SOME CHANGES TO THE SAME LINE.

Ages ago I graduated with an Associates in IT-hardware and went on to get my MCSE.  I actually never used it though and found a job at Starbucks that I worked at for about 10 years, while also coaching soccer for clubs and high school.  I decided to actually put my degree to use so signed up for devCodeCamp.

In my free time right now I still coach when I can,
