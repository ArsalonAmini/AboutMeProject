My name is Renuka and I am a student at devCodeCamp.

I am a practicing attorney in the area of Business Law; I spend most of my time reviewing contracts.  Occasionally I have to defend a contract in court or sue someone for breaching my client's contract.  I went to Marquette Law School and to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for my undergraduate degree.  I live in Glendale.

The best aspect of my work is client contact; I like working with my clients.  They are small business owners, for the most part, and are generally interesting people.  Because I am a solo practitioner, I can charge them as I wish.  I can set my own hours, so I can meet with them outside of normal business hours if necessary.  I have one client who owns a chain of stores; he usually calls me on Friday nights (he texts me first, to make sure that I am available to talk).  I have another client who owns a landscaping company; he would rather talk on the weekends.  But most of my clients are happy to meet during the week before 5:00 pm.
